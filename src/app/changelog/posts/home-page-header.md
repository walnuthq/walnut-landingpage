This week, we updated the homepage to enable users to simulate
            transactions and configure custom networks directly, without opening
            a tranasction first.

## More improvements

- Resolved an issue with content width in the Call Trace,
              eliminating unnecessary horizontal scrolling.
- The Transaction Simulation dialog will now use the
              "latest" block by default if none is provided.
- Added support for Dojo Alpha 14 and 16.
- Other minor optimizations and ongoing work to prepare for upcoming
              improvements in the debugger window.
