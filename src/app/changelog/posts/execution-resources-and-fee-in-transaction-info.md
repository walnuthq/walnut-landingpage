This week, we added new fields to the Transaction info — including Execution Resources, Estimated Fee for simulations, and Actual Fee for confirmed transactions — giving you more insight into how your transactions behave.

## More improvements

- Refined UI layout with adjusted spacing and padding for a cleaner experience.
- [Walnut Docs](https://docs.walnut.dev) updated with a new logo and refreshed appearance.
- "Total Resources" renamed to "L2 Gas" in the Flamegraph for consistency with Starknet terminology.
- Fixed a bug where some function calls were missing for verified contracts — all relevant calls are now properly displayed.
