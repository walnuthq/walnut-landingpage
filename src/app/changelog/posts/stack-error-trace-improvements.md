We've introduced a Visual Error Trace that highlights where and in which contract an error occurred. This makes it much easier to pinpoint when and where a transaction has failed, improving debugging capabilities.


## More improvements

- Added a Clear button for removing custom settings on contract addresses, giving users more control over their personalized configurations.  
- Improved data caching which resolved errors that previously blocked loading of large transactions. 
- Removed empty parentheses in the Call Trace Preview that caused confusion by suggesting calls returned nothing.
- The Transaction Hash is now displayed while a transaction is loading, so you immediately know what youâ€™re waiting for.
