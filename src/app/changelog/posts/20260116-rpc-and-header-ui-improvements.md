This week's release includes RPC improvements and header UI refinements for better responsiveness.

## More improvements

- Normalized RPC URL handling so that URLs with and without trailing slashes are treated as the same endpoint (e.g., `https://starknet-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/` and `https://starknet-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2`).
- Improved header responsiveness across different screen sizes with better breakpoint handling for network badge, search component, and user section.
- Enhanced button visibility and text wrapping in the header for better mobile experience.
