This week, we added a search feature to the call trace, allowing
            developers to search by contract address, contract name, entrypoint,
            or any Cairo function name.

## More improvements

- Users can now search by contract name and address, with search
              results showing source file names and line numbers.
- Enhanced the copy-to-clipboard functionality across the app, with
              a toast notification confirming when content is copied.
- Added short transaction hash formatting for a better mobile
              experience.
- Fixed an issue with the horizontal scroll bar in the call trace,
              ensuring it always appears.
