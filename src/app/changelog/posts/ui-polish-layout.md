This week, focus was on layout improvements and resolving an important issue affecting function call visibility.

## More improvements

- Refined UI layout with adjusted spacing and padding for a cleaner experience.
- [Walnut Docs](https://docs.walnut.dev) updated with a new logo and refreshed appearance.
- Transaction info now displays estimated fee for simulations and actual fee for confirmed transactions.
- "Total Resources" renamed to "L2 Gas" in the Flamegraph for consistency with Starknet terminology.
- Fixed a bug where some function calls were missing for verified contracts â€” all relevant calls are now properly displayed.
