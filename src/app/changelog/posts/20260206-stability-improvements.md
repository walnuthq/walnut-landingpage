This week, we improved platform stability, added better struct support in simulations, and made the contract verification source visible.

## More improvements

- Added verification source badges that clearly indicate whether a contract is verified via Voyager or Walnut.
- Resolved a server timeout issue to make the platform more stable and reliable.
- Fixed an issue where some complex data types (e.g., Layout → FieldLayout → Layout) weren’t displayed correctly in the Simulation Form
