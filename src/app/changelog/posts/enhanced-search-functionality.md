This week, we've significantly improved search functionality across Walnut! The search bar on the transaction page now follows custom settings, and the Contract page supports full-text search across both source code and entrypoints.

## More improvements

- Added search functionality for events.
- Improved search results with type chips (contract, function, event) so you always know what kind of item you’re looking at.
- Fixed a bug where search returned results that didn’t actually exist in the Call Trace.
- Improved scrollbar styling for a cleaner look and better visibility in long traces. 
- Verified chip added to class page
- Fixed layout issue in the Storage tab on mobile devices for a smoother experience.
