This week was all about bugs and improving the clarity of the transaction view.

## More improvements

- Fixed a bug where the gas chip could disappear from view unless scrolled into.
- Removed the gas chip from the debugger window to reduce visual clutter.
- Added an info message when a transaction has no storage changes: "No contract storage changes in this transaction".
- Fixed a UI bug where contract calls were being collapsed when the interface name started with core::.
- Improved error handling when a Transaction is not found, users now see a clear error with the Transaction hash and network name (e.g., Transaction hash 0x... not found on sn_main).
