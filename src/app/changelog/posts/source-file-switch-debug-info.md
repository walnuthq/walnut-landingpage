In the latest release, we improved the debugging experience by
            allowing switching between source files in the debug window.

## More improvements

- The Cairo version is now displayed in the contract details view.
- Improved error handling for contract verification.
- Added a message when no execution trace is found, instead of
              nudging users for verification.
