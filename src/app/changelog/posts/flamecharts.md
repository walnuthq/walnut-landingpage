Added a new tab that displays a Flamechart visualization of Sierra gas costs per function. This helps with performance analysis and understanding gas distribution.

## More improvements

- Sierra gas values in the call trace are now displayed with improved formatting, making thousands and hundreds visually clearer.
- Improved readability of the call trace by removing libfuncs that the Cairo compiler skips during optimization.
- Added lazy loading to the debugger, so the window now shows a loading indicator while fetching debugger data.
- As you may have noticed, the website and changelog layout have also been refreshed with a new look and structure.
