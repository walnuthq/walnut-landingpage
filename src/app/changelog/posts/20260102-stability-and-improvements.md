This week’s release delivers infrastructure updates alongside usability improvements that enhance platform stability and developer experience.

## More improvements

- Migrated from `starknet-rs` to `starknet-rust` to improve stability and reliability.
- Upgraded the RPC node provider to version `0.10` to stay aligned with the latest Starknet updates.
- Standardized value display across the application using the format `Name: Type = Value`.
- Moved the ``Expression Tab`` into a separate window in the Debugger for improved focus.
- Refined the Storage Tab UI by reducing visual clutter.
- Added an error state component to the EVM Simulation Form to handle cases where raw data cannot be decoded.
