This week, Walnut is getting BREAKPOINTS! Now you can pause the
            execution at any line to quickly inspect what's going on.

## More improvements

- Call Trace now displays calldata in auto-decoded and raw formats,
              eliminating the need for separate hex and decimal views.
- Added the Cairo Version and Networks on the Contract page.
- ContractState type is no longer shown in the debugger memory
              window, as it is a marker type with empty values.
- Fixed a bug where File Explorer was not visible in certain screen
              sizes.
