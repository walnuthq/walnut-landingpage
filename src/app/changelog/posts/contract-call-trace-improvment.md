In the latest release, we have worked on improving the Call Trace. For each contract call, you’ll now see variable names, types, and values — making it much easier to understand what’s being passed around. If the value is too long to display inline, Walnut will shorten it and let you click to reveal the full content.

## More improvements

- Added hover highlight for matching same Contract Addresses in the Call Trace — making it easier to follow repeated calls across the trace.
- Updated the color styling of Contract Call Trace fields (e.g. address, function name, arguments) for improved readability.
- Fixed a bug where the error page was not visible in dark mode.
- Fixed a bug where the expand arrow was missing for Function Calls in Call Trace.
- Images in blog posts are now clickable, allowing you to open and view them in full size.
