This week, we’ve refined several parts of the platform to make important information clearer and interactions smoother.

## More improvements

- The Verification Status page now includes a network chip for detected networks.
- Standardized error display on the Verification Status page using the Error component for a consistent look.
- Improved Mobile display for Transaction Details and Calldata for better visibility.
- Adjusted tooltip positioning on the Entrypoint page, moving it to the left for better visibility.
- The EVM Simulation Form now supports running simulations with Parameter Mode enabled, providing more flexibility for advanced inputs.
- Added support for new EVM chains — ``Arbitrum``, ``Citrea``, ``Bob``, and ``Unichain`` — expanding the range of networks you can simulate.
- In Walnut EVM, the Transaction Header now remains visible in error states, and the Re-simulate action works when simulation errors occur.
