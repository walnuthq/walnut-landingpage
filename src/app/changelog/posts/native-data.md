This week, we updated the debugger window to display values in their
            native type format instead of hexadecimal, improving the overall
            debugging experience.

## More improvements

- Added decoding support for byte arrays.
- The Transaction Detail section now displays the transactionâ€™s
              position in the block, along with the total number of transactions
              in the block.
- In the Call Trace, data tables for calldata now have proper
              borders, improving readability and navigation.
- Updated broken documentation link.
