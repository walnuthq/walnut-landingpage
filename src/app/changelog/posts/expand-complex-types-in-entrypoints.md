This week, we've enhanced the Entrypoints Tab on the Contract page! Complex function arguments are now expanded to show their full structure, making it easier to understand what inputs a function requires.

## More improvements

- Added Gas Checkbox to disable Gas display in traces for better focus on execution flow.
- Fixed Monaco editor theme bug that kept light when dark mode was enabled.
- Improved Network Chip visibility on mobile devices.
- Added Verified Chip on Contract page to visually indicate contract verification status.
