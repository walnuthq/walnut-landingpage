This week, we've improved the debugger experience with Lazy Loading and better file navigation,  
making debugging more user-friendly.

## More improvements

- Fixed expression highlighting in the debugger — when hovering over an expression,  
  the correct file now opens even if you had another file active.  
- Added formatted error messages with expandable details.  
- Improved file navigation — when switching between contract files,  
  they now always open at the first line to ensure code is visible.  
- Fixed the incorrect link in [Dojo docs](https://dojoengine.org/toolchain/sozo/project-management#sozo-walnut) that pointed to Walnut’s verification documentation.
- Combined network chips for contracts that exist on multiple networks, reducing clutter.
