We finally added the 'Step Over' button, one of the most
            requested features from our early users. It speeds up the debugging
            experience by allowing developers to skip over functions and focus
            on the main logic, saving time and reducing the need to manually
            step through each line in deeply nested code.

## More improvements

- Enhanced the Call Trace with __validate__ Account
              call, to better express Starknet's Account Abstraction model .
- Updated the copy and added a link to the Walnut Verification Guide in the debugger window for non-verified contracts.
- Addressed and resolved minor bugs to improve overall application
              stability and performance.
