This week, we focused on enhancing platform stability and aligning with industry standards with a series of improvements and fixes.

## More improvements

- Added support for the latest Starknet 0.14.0 release, improving stability and compatibility with the newest protocol features.
- Renamed MAIN to MAINNET to align with standards and best practices for network identification.
- Improved search functionality by trimming whitespace from queries, preventing bugs when copying text with leading or trailing spaces.
- Ensured transaction hash is always displayed as a header, even when errors occur, for a more consistent experience.
- Added explicit error messages for unsupported transaction types, giving users clearer feedback about compatibility.
- Enhanced display of enum variants and struct members with clearer labeling, making it easier to distinguish between `enum_variants` and `struct_members`.
