This week, we upgraded core dependencies: Cairo compiler, SN
            Foundry, and Blockifier. This ensures better compatibility,
            stability, and support for the latest protocol changes.

## More improvements

- Fixed a bug in gas computation that made transactions show the
              wrong status during simulation.
- Updated Simulations docs to align with the new Simulation page.
- Enabled contract verification with sncast verify using --class-hash .
