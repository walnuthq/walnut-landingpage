This week, weâ€™ve enhanced the Contract Page with a new **Simulation** experience. A new **Simulation button** has been added in the Entrypoints tab, allowing you to open the transaction simulation page directly and streamline your experience.


## More improvements

- Implemented entrypoint search functionality during simulation, making it faster to find specific entrypoint you want to test.
- Added the ability to copy non-hex arguments.
- Updated Rust to version `1.89.0` for improved performance and latest language features.
- Upgraded Cairo to version `2.12.3`, bringing the latest improvements and bug fixes.
- Fixed a bug where error messages weren't displayed in red color.
