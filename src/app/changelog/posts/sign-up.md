This week, we added the ability to sign up to Walnut using a GitHub
            Account.

## More improvements

- Added proper handling for transactions that REVERT due to
              "run out of resources" error.
- Improved syntax highlighting in Walnut Docs, making code snippets
              more readable.
- Removed the Events Tab. We plan to bring events back later.
