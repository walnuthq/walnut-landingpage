This week, we've added a new Error UI component that clearly distinguishes server errors from all other application errors, making issues easier to understand.

## More improvements

- Improved readability of contract display on the Class page — contracts are now grouped by network, making it clear which contract belongs to which network.
- Adjusted padding on the Class page inside Contract tabs for better readability.
- Clicking a Contract Address on the Class page now opens the corresponding Contract page.
- Clicking a Class Hash on the Contract page now opens the corresponding Class page.
- Added a checkbox next to the Verification Badge on Class and Contract pages, along with a tooltip and documentation link for easier understanding of the verification process.
- Expanded our documentation with a new section on [Walnut EVM verification](https://docs.walnut.dev/walnut-evm/verify-evm-contracts-in-walnut), covering how to verify EVM contracts on Walnut EVM.
