In the latest release, we focused on enhancing the information box
            on the transaction page. We now display the transaction type,
            timestamp, and transaction version.

## More improvements

- Added support for Declare transactions.
- Input and output data can now be switched between Hexadecimal and
              Decimal formats, and vice versa.
- Improved handling of transaction simulation errors.
