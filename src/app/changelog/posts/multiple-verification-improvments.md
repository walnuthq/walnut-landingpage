In the latest release, we introduced support for verifying multiple
            classes in a single request. This improves the Class Verification
            user experience and boosts performance.

## More improvements

- Added support for Dojo Alpha 12, to support the latest on-chain
              game developers.
- Increased server resources to ensure faster response time and
              handle high-demand requests.
- Improved error handling by mapping errors, leading to clearer and
              more detailed debugging information.
- Addressed several Class Verification issues reported primarily by
              DOJO game developers. These include configuring Scarb caching for
              Sozo and applying the default namespace from the Dojo
              configuration.
