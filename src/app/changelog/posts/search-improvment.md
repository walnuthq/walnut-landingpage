In the latest release, we added a footer to search results that
            shows the networks being queried, making it easier to recognize when
            a custom network should be set if the search doesn't return
            expected results.

## More improvements

- As part of ongoing improvements to the Call Trace, we removed the
              "Unknown Function" frame which was only causing
              confusion.
- Collaborated with Dojo to support Katana blocks with multiple
              transactions. Thanks Dojo for your help on this issue #2458 .
- Added support for Dojo Alpha 13.
- Updated the Contract Verification service to support Cairo 2.8.2.
