We’ve introduced a new Entrypoints Tab on the Contract page! It lets you easily explore all read and write functions defined in the contract — no need to scan through the source code.

## More improvements

- Added network logos next to transaction headline and search results for easier identification.
- Transaction info clearly shows the network via the new Stack field.
- Search tooltip clarifies which networks were included in the query.
- Fixed an issue where searched network indicators were displayed incorrectly.
- Fixed broken search input appearance and padding issues.
- Cleaned up unnecessary local storage usage.
- Renamed "sn_main" and "sn_sepolia" to "Starknet Mainnet" and "Starknet Sepolia" for clarity.
