This week, we've expanded Search functionality across the Walnut! The Search bar on the Transaction Page now follows Custom Settings, and the Contract Page supports full search across both Source Code and Entrypoints.

## More improvements

- Added search functionality for Events.
- Improved search results with type chips (Contract, Function, Event) so you always know what kind of item you’re looking at.
- Fixed a bug where search returned results that didn’t actually exist in the Call Trace.
- Improved scrollbar styling for a cleaner look and better visibility in long traces.
- Verified Chip added to class page.
- Fixed layout issue in the Storage Tab on mobile devices for a smoother experience.
