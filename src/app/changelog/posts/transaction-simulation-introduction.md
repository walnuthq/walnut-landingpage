In this release we added support for transaction simulations into
            Walnut. You can simulate a new transaction, or re-simulate an
            existing one.

## More improvements

- New transaction simulation screen that allows to re-run existing
              transactions or simulate new ones on the Starknet Mainnet network
- Simulations support modification of the following transaction
              parameters: sender address, calldata, block number, chain id, and
              transaction version
