This week, we introduced an Events Tab, allowing users to view all
            emitted events by a given transaction. This helps track contract
            interactions and debug more efficiently.

## More improvements

- List of Events for both failed and successful transactions.
- Each Event shows emitted data, allowing users to inspect event
              contents directly.
- Improved colors in the Call Trace and made them more consistent: Types — Orange Names — Green Values — Dark Orange
