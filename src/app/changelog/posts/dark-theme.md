This week, weâ€™re excited to introduce Dark Mode. You can now switch between light and dark themes to match your environment â€” whether youâ€™re debugging in broad daylight or burning the midnight oil, Walnut fits right in.

## More improvements

- Migrated [Walnut Docs](https://docs.walnut.dev) to **Docusaurus** for a cleaner and more pro experience.
- Fixed a bug where simulation would fail if Starknet Foundry returned an empty transaction trace for a class hash.
- Improved error messaging for the verification process â€” instead of the vague "signal: 9 (SIGKILL)" message, users now see a clearer explanation: *The verification process was terminated due to resource limits. Please contact support for assistance.*
- Published a new blog post on using the Walnut Flamechart to analyze Starknet transaction gas costs: [Analyse Gas Usage in Starknet Transactions with Walnut Flamegraphs](https://walnut.dev/blog/gas-calculation).
