This week, we added support for theme switcher â€” you can now choose the interface style that fits your preference. Whether you're debugging mid-day or late at night, Walnut adapts to your workflow.

## More improvements

- Migrated [Walnut Docs](https://docs.walnut.dev) to **Docusaurus** for a cleaner and more user-friendly experience.
- Fixed a bug where simulation would fail if Starknet Foundry returned an empty transaction trace for a class hash.
- Improved verification process error messaging â€” instead of the old error message: "signal: 9 (SIGKILL)", users now see: *The verification process was terminated due to resource limits. Please contact support for assistance.*
- Published a new blog post: [Analyse Gas Usage in Starknet Transactions with Walnut Flamegraphs](https://walnut.dev/blog/gas-calculation)
