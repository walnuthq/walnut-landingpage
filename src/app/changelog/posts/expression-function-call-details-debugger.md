This week, we've made function-level debugging clearer and more intuitive. The Function Call Details panel now displays information about the current execution step, including the line number, arguments, and resultsâ€”making it easier to see what's being passed and returned during CairoVM execution.

## More improvements

- Fixed an issue where the result type name was displayed twice in
              the Function Call Details panel.
- Resolved a problem where some functions were not found during
              multicall simulation.
- Improved system call mappings, fixing a bug that blocked debugging
              during simulations.
