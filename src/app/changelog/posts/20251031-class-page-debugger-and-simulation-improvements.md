This week, we’ve improved the Class Page with a new Contract tab that shows all contracts linked to a specific class hash.

## More improvements

- Improved the display of Arguments, Types, and Values in the Call Trace and Function Call Details windows within the Debugger.  
- Added Value display in the Events tab, similar to the Call Trace view.  
- Enabled Re-Simulate button for undeployed contracts.
- Fixed a bug that caused Invalid Calldata during Simulation in Parameters mode when using an array of tuples as an argument.  
- Fixed a bug that didn’t fill values correctly in Simulation with Parameters mode when handling arrays of tuples.
- Fixed a bug that displayed incorrect argument names.
