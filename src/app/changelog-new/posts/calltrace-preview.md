This week, we improved the debugging experience by integrating the Call Trace directly into the debugger window. Users can now track code execution and the full call trace side by side, making it easier to analyze transactions and debug complex interactions.

## More improvements

- The debugger window now has three panels: Function Call Details, Call Trace Preview, and File Explorer.
- Events are now visible in the Call Trace, linked to their corresponding function calls.
- Enhanced Events tab with Contract address and Event selector information.
- Added horizontal scrolling in the Events tab.
