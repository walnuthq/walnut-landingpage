                          On Starknet, transactions represent the execution of
                          programs written in the Cairo programming language.
                          Each transaction (or program execution) is identified
                          by a unique transaction hash, making it traceable and
                          distinguishable. For instance, running the same
                          program twenty times will result in twenty unique
                          transactions, each with its own transaction hash. Like
                          any program execution, the behavior of these
                          transactions can be analyzed through a Call Trace, a
                          detailed log that captures the functions invoked, the
                          arguments passed, the outputs returned, and more. For
                          developers, Call Traces are essential for
                          understanding program execution, identifying issues,
                          and optimizing performance. In this post, we will go
                          through an example Call Trace of a Starknet
                          Transaction line by line to better explain how it
                          works in detail.

                        <h2>Specifics of Starknet Call Traces</h2>
                        <p>
                          As mentioned in the introduction, Starknet transaction
                          execution can be represented using a traditional Call
                          Trace, as it reflects the execution of a program.
                          Unlike traditional program execution, where all
                          function calls are treated uniformly, there are
                          differences that result in the structure of the Call
                          Trace. These differences arise from the existence of
                          multiple types of calls within a transaction. These
                          include calls made within a single smart contract and
                          calls to other smart contracts. To distinguish between
                          these, the Call Trace component in Walnut includes
                          Chips that specify the type of each call (also
                          referred to as frames). A Chip labeled ‚ÄúCall‚Äù
                          represents a call to a smart contract, while a Chip
                          labeled ‚ÄúFunction‚Äù denotes a regular function call
                          within a contract. For a complete reference of call
                          types, see the{" "}

                        <p>
                          The __validate__ function is the initial validation
                          frame of each INVOKE transaction on Starknet. This
                          function is designed to ensure that the transaction
                          meets the criteria set by the account contract, before
                          it proceeds to the actual program execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In our transaction example, as shown in the Call Trace
                          above, the __validate__ function performs the
                          following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Calldata Deserialization:</strong> The
                            transaction data, or calldata, is deserialized to
                            prepare it for further validation and processing.
                            Calldata is the information sent from an external
                            caller to the contract, and it contains all the
                            necessary parameters required for executing the
                            transaction.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Signature Validation:</strong> The function
                            verifies the caller&apos;s signature, ensuring that
                            only authorized accounts can initiate the
                            transaction.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          It&apos;s worth noting that the exact implementation
                          of __validate__ is flexible and up to the Account
                          provider (in our example, Argent), and permissions or
                          signature validation may not always be required. The
                          purpose of this function is to confirm that the
                          transaction aligns with the account&apos;s defined
                          rules. Each Account Contract on Starknet is required
                          to implement the __validate__ method. You can read
                          more here.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If __validate__ asserts, the transaction is REJECTED
                          and does not proceed further.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Once __validate__ passes, the __execute__ function is
                          invoked with the same Calldata. This is the stage
                          where the core actions of transaction are performed:

                          <li>
                            <strong>Calldata Deserialization:</strong> Just as
                            in the validation phase, calldata is prepared for
                            use in the core transaction logic.
                          </li>

                            <strong>Multicall Execution:</strong> After
                            deserialization phase, it moves on to multicall.
                            Starknet supports native multicall functionality
                            through __execute__, allowing a single transaction
                            to perform multiple actions within the same contract
                            or across different contracts. This capability is
                            unique to Starknet, as Ethereum requires separate
                            contracts to implement similar functionality. For
                            more information on how multicalls work in Starknet,

                          After successfully passing the validation phases,
                          get_beer() is called through Starknet&apos;s multicall
                          functionality. The multicall process is managed by the
                          execute_multicall() function, which iterates over each
                          call provided in the transaction&apos;s calldata. For
                          each call, execute_multicall() uses the
                          call_contract_syscall() function to pass the target
                          contract address, the entrypoint selector, and any
                          parameters required by the function - in this case,
                          the get_beer() function on the IBeer2 contract.

                          An entrypoint is a function in a contract that can be

                          method is part of an internal logic of the IBeer2

                          IVerificationHelper contract is invoked to calculate
                          the proof. Internally, the corresponding function
                          handles the actual calculation logic, ensuring the

                          contract call. While it looks like a simple function
                          call, it&apos;s interacting with the
                          IVerificationHelper contract, which contains logic to

                        <p>
                          This transaction walkthrough illustrated how each
                          phase relies on a combination of entrypoints and
                          internal function calls. The __validate__ and
                          __execute__ functions ensure the transaction&apos;s
                          security and execution, while subsequent entrypoints
                          handle specific contract operations. Entrypoints
                          manage the initial external interactions, and function
                          calls handle the detailed internal logic. This
                          structure provides a complete, traceable path from the
                          start of a request to the completion of its internal
                          execution.

                          transaction unfolds within the network. Call Traces
                          help developers and auditors understand exactly what
                          happened during a transaction. Here&apos;s why they
