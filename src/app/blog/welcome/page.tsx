                          We are excited to launch this blog as a platform for sharing
                          our experiences, challenges, and advancements in developing

                          Starknet. Our goal is to foster insightful discussions and
                          actively engage with community feedback.

                          Our first product, the Walnut Debugger, is a visual,
                          step-by-step debugger designed for Starknet developers who
                          work with Cairo. Currently in its closed Beta stage, we
                          anticipate launching in Q1 2024. The Walnut Debugger fills a
                          critical gap by being the first debugger built for Cairo. If
                          you&apos;re interested in early access, we&apos;d love to
                          hear from you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          While we recognize that a debugger alone is not enough to
                          fulfill our mission for the rapidly expanding Starknet
                          developer community, we see it as a crucial step. With this
                          understanding, let&apos;s delve into other areas and tools
                          we at Walnut are developing, each tailored to address
                          specific challenges Starknet developers face.

                              <strong>Storage diff visualization.</strong> Developers
                              need better visibility into smart contract storage and
                              how transactions affect it. This tool is particularly
                              useful for optimizing smart contract memory. On
                              Starknet, transaction costs are mostly impacted by
                              storage, therefore the ability to optimize storage is
                              vital.

                              <strong>Gas profiling.</strong> Starknet&apos;s
                              execution may be generally cheap, but visibility into
                              gas consumption is still necessary. Poorly written
                              contracts can consume excessive gas, even on Starknet.
                              Gas profilers offer monitoring capabilities and assist
                              in improving the gas footprint.

                              predefined on-chain events on Starknet. For instance, a
                              developer could set up a Telegram notification when a
                              loan health factor drops below a certain percentage.
