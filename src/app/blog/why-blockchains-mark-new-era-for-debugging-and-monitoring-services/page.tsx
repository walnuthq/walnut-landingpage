                        <p>
                          The earliest computers were rudimentary, with programming
                          done via punched cards and machine code. Debugging was
                          mostly a manual process, often involving physical inspection
                          of the hardware and simple printouts.

                        <p>
                          <strong>Interesting fact:</strong> The term “debugging”
                          became widely known in this era due to an incident in 1947

                          UNIX-based machines. These machines are well-understood by
                          the existing monitoring services and have been established
                          for a long time, providing a familiar environment for
                          developers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain applications do not
                          run on existing operating systems like UNIX. Instead, they
                          typically run in specialised virtual machines, such as the
                          Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Programs are invoked through
                          transactions, and the execution is irreversible and
                          permanent. Programs are encoded as smart contracts, deployed
                          to the blockchain in the form of bytecode.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          There is a need for a specialised monitoring system that
                          understands the specifics of blockchain Virtual Machines
                          such as the EVM or Cairo VM or Solana VM.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
                        <p>
                          Data storage involves how data is managed and stored and in
                          what format it is encoded, which affects how monitoring
                          services deal with the data for later processing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Cloud:</strong> Traditional databases such as
                          PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server are used. These systems
                          are centralised and well-understood by existing monitoring
                          tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Data is stored in a distributed
                          manner using structures like Merkle trees and other
                          cryptographic methods. This storage format approach is
                          unfamiliar to many traditional monitoring systems, requiring
                          a different approach for decoding and understanding the
                          data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Monitoring systems built for Cloud and Mobile applications
                          do not understand the specifics of blockchain data format.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Runtime Context and Logs</h3>
                        <p>
                          Existing solutions like Sentry and DataDog rely on runtime
                          logs created by applications running on mobile devices or in
                          the cloud. Blockchains, due to their decentralised style,
                          have a very different approach to logging.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Cloud:</strong> Programs usually generate logs about
                          their execution, which are utilised by monitoring services
                          like DataDog or Sentry to provide insights into problems and
                          potential fixes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Logs generated by blockchain
                          nodes are very scarce and almost non-existent. This is due
                          to the nature of blockchains, where every program is
                          re-executed by thousands of validators, making it
                          impractical and expensive to generate extensive logs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Blockchains do not generate logs and runtime context about
                          program execution because it would be too expensive. There
                          is a need for a radically different approach that involves
                          re-running, or simulating blockchain programs in a
                          controlled environment, to generate the extra logging and
                          analytics required.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
                        <p>
                          Programming languages used to write programs significantly
                          affect the tools and methods required for monitoring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Cloud:</strong> The most popular programming
                          languages include Python, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Go.
                          These languages are well-supported by existing debugging and
                          monitoring tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain development requires
                          new and specialised languages. Examples include Solidity for
                          Ethereum and all EVM chains, Cairo for Starknet, Noir for
                          Aztec, and Rust for Solana.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Blockchains need monitoring software tailored to the
                          specific languages they use.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Program Source Code</h3>
                        <p>
                          The way Blockchains function brings new problems to how the
                          program source code is bundled, which causes challenges to
                          monitoring previously unseen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Cloud:</strong> The program&apos;s source code is
                          fully created and owned by the program creator, making it
                          straightforward to debug and monitor. If the program has
                          dependencies to other libraries, those will be compiled with
                          the program to generate a single, self-containing bundle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> Blockchain applications coexist
                          and interact with other apps on the same chain, forming a
                          super-app. Developers often rely on other apps’
                          functionality without having access to their source code,
                          posing unique challenges for debuggers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <i>An example:</i> The lending application zkLend can call
                          another application Ekubo to perform swaps of tokens in the
                          case of liquidation. The zkLend team only has access to the
                          zkLend&apos;s source code, and the zkLend&apos;s app bundle
                          only contains code related to zkLend. Even though the zkLend
                          app relies on Ekubo’s code, it doesn’t contain any Ekubo
                          app’s code in its app bundle. In Solana, this is called
                          Cross Program Invocation, and you can read more about it{" "}

                        <p>
                          The fact that blockchain apps often rely on other apps, but
                          at the same time do not have other app’s code in their
                          bundle, poses unique challenges for debuggers, which need to
                          understand the full context of all of the apps on the
                          blockchain in order to correctly present issues caused by
                          dependencies.

                        <p>
                          Performance monitoring is a subcategory of application
                          monitoring services. It focuses on tracking and managing the
                          performance and availability of software applications to
                          detect and diagnose complex performance issues, ensuring
                          optimal user experiences and system reliability.

                        <p>
                          <strong>Cloud:</strong> Users are billed based on the
                          resources they consume, such as compute power, storage, and
                          bandwidth. Pricing models are typically transparent and
                          predictable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> The cost structure is more
                          complex and is based on GAS, which price is dynamic and
                          varies all the time. Costs include transaction fees, smart
                          contract deployment, storage, and validator incentives.
                          These factors can fluctuate based on network demand and
                          other variables.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Blockchain apps handle application performance and cost very
                          differently. This requires specialised performance
                          monitoring tools that understand the concept of gas and the
                          role it plays in blockchain applications.

                          In the previous section, we explained differences between
                          blockchains and Cloud systems, and presented concrete
                          examples why existing web2 monitoring systems (like Sentry
                          or DataDog) fall short in the new blockchain era. We
                          provided concrete examples of why blockchains present an
                          opportunity for new monitoring systems to emerge, purpose
                          built for the challenges introduced by blockchains.

                          In this section, we will explore some of the emerging tools

                        <p>
                          Tenderly is one of the most comprehensive tools for solving
                          the problems discussed in this article. Tenderly started
                          around 7 years ago with a debugger service for Ethereum and
                          EVM, and is now used by many Ethereum and EVM developers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Over time, Tenderly added more advanced features like
                          transaction simulations, testnets for users who need to
                          develop applications privately, real time alerts and
                          detailed gas visualisation of transaction traces. Today,
                          Tenderly supports over 60 EVM chains. The company{" "}

                        <h3>Opportunity for New Players to Enter the Market</h3>
                        <p>
                          Tenderly has been a prominent player in advancing a
                          comprehensive blockchain monitoring system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          However, the blockchain monitoring market still faces
                          significant challenges. Tenderly&apos;s focus on EVM chains
                          leaves many other chains without solutions. Numerous non-EVM
                          chains, including many recent ZK-based validity rollups,
                          lack support. Even zkSync and Scroll, validity rollups that
                          claim EVM compatibility, are unsupported by Tenderly due to
                          differences in their underlying VMs. Additionally, smaller
                          fully EVM-compatible rollups also often lack Tenderly
                          support, likely due to cost considerations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It&apos;s not just about Tenderly; there&apos;s substantial
                          room for improvement. More options are needed within the EVM
                          ecosystem, and non-EVM chains currently lack solutions for
                          real-time monitoring and debugging.

                          To provide an estimate of the market opportunity for
                          blockchain monitoring, we will first analyse the size of
                          monitoring in Web 2.0 and calculate the ratio between
                          monitoring services and the total market cap of Web 2.0. We
                          will then estimate the blockchain market and its potential
                          growth. Finally, we will use the same ratio of monitoring
                          services market cap to the total Web 2.0 market cap and
                          apply it to the blockchain market cap to estimate the
                          potential of blockchain monitoring.

                          services for Web 2.0 is not explicitly available as a single
                          aggregated figure. However, combining the valuations above,
                          we estimate the application monitoring market is worth ~
                          $100 billion, or approximately 1% of the total $14.8
                          trillion Web 2.0 market. Given the same estimation, the
                          opportunity for blockchain monitoring services is projected
                          to be $9.52 billion.

                          Significant gaps exist in blockchain debugging and
                          monitoring tools. Financial impacts of blockchain-related
                          errors are substantial, with vulnerabilities and bugs in
                          smart contracts leading to losses exceeding $1 billion over
                          the past three years (
                          <a
                            href="https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/web-market-report"

                          </a>
                          ). As financial institutions like JPMorgan and HSBC move
                          more activities to blockchain, the potential for significant
                          financial losses due to errors increases. Robust debugging
                          and monitoring tools are critical to mitigating these risks
                          and ensuring the security of financial operations (

                          In conclusion, the substantial financial impact of
                          blockchain-related errors underscores the critical need for
                          advanced debugging and monitoring solutions. As blockchain
                          technology continues to integrate deeper into existing
                          systems like finance, healthcare, logistics, gaming, and
                          social, these tools are essential to safeguard against
                          risks.
