                              programs while gaining a deeper understanding of their inner
                              workings. It is especially useful for those learning Cairo,
                              but it also functions as a capable debugger. The tool
                              presents detailed information about the CairoVM execution
                              and memory, while providing mappings from the execution
                              trace to CASM, Sierra, and Cairo.

                                test their programs, making cairovm.codes a valuable tool
                                for both learning and debugging Cairo programs.

                              using the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrevious‚Äù buttons, developers can
                              rerun the program execution, analyzing how registers,
                              memory, or the function call stack change over time. With
                              each step, cairovm.codes highlights the corresponding Cairo,
                              CASM, and Sierra code, visually showing which line of code
                              is being executed.
