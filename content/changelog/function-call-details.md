We're excited to introduce a brand new Memory Window in the
            Debugger to display function call arguments and results.

## More improvements

- Made debugger windows resizable, giving you more control over your
              workspace and helping you focus on what matters.
- Core Starknet functions in the call trace are now collapsed by
              default, making large transactions easier to navigate.
- Added support for class hash verification, a feature requested by
              StarkWare.
- Fixed contract display issues in the call trace to make the
              application more reliable.
