In this release, we've introduced a new Class Page that
            displays details about the class, including the Class Hash, the list
            of networks where the class is declared, and the associated source
            code.

## More improvements

- Added form validation to the Transaction Simulation dialog to help
              users avoid errors and ensure correct input.
- Included ContractState function argument in the Call
              Trace, enabling users to explore these values.
- Fixed a bug that caused inconsistent state when declare, deploy,
              and invoke transactions occurred within the same block. This
              improvement ensures accurate and reliable transaction processing
              in this scenario.
- Improved the loading state text in the Contract Verification
              window for clarity.
