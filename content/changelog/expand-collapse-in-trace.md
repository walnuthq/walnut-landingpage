Last week, we introduced several updates to enhance the Call Trace
            feature and improve overall product quality.

## More improvements

- Introduced expand and collapse buttons to the Call Trace, making
              navigation between call frames easier and more intuitive.
- Fixed several bugs, resulting in improved stability and overall
              product quality.
- Added special handling to the call trace to report cases where
              source code locations are missing.
- The Cairo VM and Cairo compiler crates were upgraded to the latest
              versions, allowing simulations of transactions with contracts up
              to Cairo v2.8.2.
