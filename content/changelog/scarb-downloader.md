title: Support for *ALL* Cairo versions
date: 2024-12-13
---

This week, we built an automation that allows our Contract
            Verification Service to automatically support new Cairo versions as
            soon as they are released. No more "unsupported Cairo
            version" messages during smart contract verification on
            Starknet!

## More improvements

- Retro-added support for Cairo versions 2.9.1 and 2.9.2.
- Updated the Transaction Simulation Form to use
              transactionÂ version 3 as the default
              option.
